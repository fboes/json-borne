JSON-borne
==========

Why invent a new JSON structure for your application if there are already tons of well-documented and interoperable JSON data structures? This repository is an ever growing list of well-defined JSON data sets.

### General conversions

There is a [general way to convert XML data structures into JSON data structures](http://blog.3960.org/post/8478676503/rss-mit-json).

### Geolocation and places

* [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) lets you store geometric points, lines and polygons much like KML. It can be read by[ Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/utility/geojson?hl=de) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/)

###  Syndication

* [JSON-RSS](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html) as proposed by Dave Winer himself converts the true and trusted RSS into JSON. Currently there is no service out there to digest this information, but it is a convenient way to offer your published articles via REST-API. There is also a [live example for JSON-RSS](http://blog.3960.org/post/8478676503/rss-mit-json).
* [JSON-Sitemap](sitemap.json) tries to output [XML-Sitemaps](http://www.sitemaps.org/de/protocol.html) in JSON. This may be useful to have a list of all URLs in a given domain.

### Metadata & Linking

* [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) is used by Google Knowledge Graph, and describes relations in a given document.

### Articles

* [Apple News Article](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/Apple_News_Format_Ref/StructureOverview.html) lets you describe articles in JSON. These articles can be read by Apple News.
